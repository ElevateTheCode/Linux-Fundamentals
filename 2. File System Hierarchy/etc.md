# `/etc` Directory

- Contains system-wide configuration files.
- **`ls /etc | grep conf`**: A common command to find configuration files.
- **`/etc/shadow`**: This file contains user passwords (hashed), accessible only by the root user.
- **`/etc/sudoers`**: The configuration file for the `sudo` command. A misconfiguration here is a major security risk.
