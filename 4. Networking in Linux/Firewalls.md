# Firewalls (`ufw` and `iptables`)

- `ufw` (`sudo ufw status`): A simple firewall manager.
- `iptables` (`sudo iptables -L`): The more complex and powerful firewall.
- **Security Implications**: Attackers look for open ports (via scanning) and misconfigured firewall rules to gain access to a system.
